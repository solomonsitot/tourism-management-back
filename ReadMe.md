## GitHub Workflow Rules

### Branching Structure:
- All team members must clone the repository and start their work by checking out from the `test` branch.
- Individual features or tasks must be developed on separate branches prefixed with `feature/`, followed by a descriptive feature name, e.g., `feature/login-page`.

### Merging Workflow:
- Before merging any feature branch into the `test` branch, team members must communicate with their peers to ensure smooth integration and to resolve any potential conflicts.
- Merging into the `test` branch should only be done when the feature is fully developed and tested.

### Pull Requests and Commit Messages:
- When merging a feature branch into the `test` branch, team members must create a pull request.
- The pull request title should succinctly describe the feature or task being merged.
- Commit messages accompanying the pull request must be meaningful and descriptive, providing clear information about the changes made.
